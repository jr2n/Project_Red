This plugin is functional now, including in multiprocess environments.
The plugin has been tested on Redmine 1.1, 1.2.0, 2.2-stable and 2.3.2 (report by Jérôme BATAILLE).
The database is used for intermediate storage.

To install:
- Prerequisites: Unless you are using ruby-1.9, you'll need the fastercsv gem (<code>gem install fastercsv</code> as root).
  Versions 1.4 through 1.5.3 are tested.
- Download the plugin to your 'plugins/' directory.  Be sure to maintain the correct folder name, 'redmine_importer'.
- Run <code>rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code>
- Restart your redmine as appropriate (e.g., <code>ruby script/rails server -e production</code>)
- Go to the Admin/Projects/../Modules
- Enable "Importer"

en, de, zh, pl, pt-BR, ru and ja localizations included.
The other localizations are up to date, but the zh is a little bit behind.
If anyone could update it, it would be appreciated.
